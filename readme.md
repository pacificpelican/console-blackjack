**Console Blackjack**
*is a JavaScript card deck engine created by [Dan McKeown](http://danmckeown.info)*

When you create a blackjack object [based on a matchup object] it pits two players against each other by drawing cards from an array used to keep track of which cards have been drawn, which mirrors a constant array of all the playing cards.  From there functionality is provided in methods to use the deck to play a game of blackjack between two players.  You can see how this works when you view the [project index page](index.html) in a browser and see a list of JavaScript console commands that help demonstrate the app.

Console Blackjack is released under the [MIT license](LICENSE).

Console Blackjack is what's behind [the 21 game at djmblog.com](http://djmblog.com/blackjack).

The deck can also be used to provide cards for other types of card games.
